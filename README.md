# Tcriss portfolio

I finally manage to create my own portfolio where people can know about my learning path, skills and me.

This page is powered by Astro, a js framework perfect for building fast and performance web pages content-only oriented, like landing pages or blogs.

For the UI I used what I learned about tailwindCSS, a tool i recommend a lot if you already master css.

### ðŸš€ Features

- ServerSide Rendering: Content is rendered in the server in order to performs faster and lighter.
- Image optimization: Thanks to astro, images are optimized for the client, taking less weight it would normally required in a vanilla web page.
- SEO: Astro focuses on improving the SEO.

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
